### ABSTRACT

Computer Vision has always been the integral part of environment interacting robots. Image Processing is the first and the very basic step towards the betterment of the ability of a robot to visualize and objectify it’s environment.  Through the virtue of this project we will try to develop a environment interacting bot with hard coded instructions to react to it’s vision system. Predefined Objects are the most basic form of features is that an environment can have and the ability to ensure it’s existence in the robotic space and react according to it’s relative position in the frame would be the indication for a successful vision enabled robotics. 

### AIM

Our project aims to identify and locate an object so that it's relative positioning can automate a RC bot.  

### INTRODUCTION

Object tracking is a modern computer vision technique where a machine has the ability to identify an object. There are a number of ways to detect and track an object but
